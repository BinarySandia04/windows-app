# Windows App test
This my first C++ OpenGl + Win32 API app for Windows!

I'm trying to do my best by understanding OpenGl and Win32 API. I'm very confused so I usually
do copy & paste. If you're interested, I'm learning OpenGl from this website:

So, this app now what actually does is display a cube. And you can, for example, look at it and observe how it rotates.
It's very satisfying.
